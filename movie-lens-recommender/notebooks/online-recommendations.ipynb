The first one is that a Spark cluster is a distrubuted environment of **Workers** orchestrated from the Spark **Master** where the Python script is launched. This means that the master is the only one with access to the submitted script and local additional files. If we want the workers to be able to access additional imported Python moules, they either have to be part of our Python distributuon or we need to pass them implicitly. We do this by using the `pyFiles=['engine.py', 'app.py']` parameter when creating the `SparkContext` object. "

For example, we cannot make reference to a class instance variables. Because of this, we have defined all the functions that are passed to RDD transformations outside the `RecommendationEgine` class.  "
