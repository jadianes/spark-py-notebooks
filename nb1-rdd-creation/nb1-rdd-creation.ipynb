    "In this notebook we will introduce two different ways of getting data into the basic Spark data structure, the **Resilient Distributed Dataset** or **RDD**. An RDD is a distributed collection of elements. All work in Spark is expressed as either creating new RDDs, transforming existing RDDs, or calling actions on RDDs to compute a result. Spark automatically distributes the data contained in RDDs across your cluster and parallelizes the operations you perform on them."
